; "setvar" to set variables that can be used in the dialplan for various limits.

[general]
context=public                  ; Default context for incoming calls. Defaults to 'default'
;allowguest=yes                 ; Allow or reject guest calls (default is yes)
				; If your Asterisk is connected to the Internet
				; and you have allowguest=yes
				; you want to check which services you offer everyone
				; out there, by enabling them in the default context (see below).
;match_auth_username=yes        ; if available, match user entry using the
                                ; 'username' field from the authentication line
                                ; instead of the From: field.
;allowoverlap=no                 ; Disable overlap dialing support. (Default is yes)
;allowoverlap=yes               ; Enable RFC3578 overlap dialing support.
                                ; Can use the Incomplete application to collect the
                                ; needed digits from an ambiguous dialplan match.
;allowoverlap=dtmf              ; Enable overlap dialing support using DTMF delivery
                                ; methods (inband, RFC2833, SIP INFO) in the early
                                ; media phase.  Uses the Incomplete application to
                                ; collect the needed digits.
;allowtransfer=no               ; Disable all transfers (unless enabled in peers or users)
                                ; Default is enabled. The Dial() options 't' and 'T' are not
                                ; related as to whether SIP transfers are allowed or not.
;realm=mydomain.tld             ; Realm for digest authentication
                                ; defaults to "asterisk". If you set a system name in
                                ; asterisk.conf, it defaults to that system name
                                ; Realms MUST be globally unique according to RFC 3261
                                ; Set this to your host name or domain name
;domainsasrealm=no              ; Use domains list as realms
                                ; You can serve multiple Realms specifying several
                                ; 'domain=...' directives (see below).
                                ; In this case Realm will be based on request 'From'/'To' header
                                ; and should match one of domain names.
                                ; Otherwise default 'realm=...' will be used.
;recordonfeature=automixmon	; Default feature to use when receiving 'Record: on' header
				; from an INFO message. Defaults to 'automon'. Works with
				; dynamic features. Feature must be usable on requesting
				; channel for it to work. Setting this value to a blank
				; will disable it.
;recordofffeature=automixmon	; Default feature to use when receiving 'Record: off' header
				; from an INFO message. Defaults to 'automon'. Works with
				; dynamic features. Feature must be usable on requesting
				; channel for it to work. Setting this value to a blank
				; will disable it.

; With the current situation, you can do one of four things:
;  a) Listen on a specific IPv4 address.      Example: bindaddr=192.0.2.1
;  b) Listen on a specific IPv6 address.      Example: bindaddr=2001:db8::1
;  c) Listen on the IPv4 wildcard.            Example: bindaddr=0.0.0.0
;  d) Listen on the IPv4 and IPv6 wildcards.  Example: bindaddr=::
; (You can choose independently for UDP, TCP, and TLS, by specifying different values for
; "udpbindaddr", "tcpbindaddr", and "tlsbindaddr".)
; (Note that using bindaddr=:: will show only a single IPv6 socket in netstat.
;  IPv4 is supported at the same time using IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses.)
;
; You may optionally add a port number. (The default is port 5060 for UDP and TCP, 5061
; for TLS).
;   IPv4 example: bindaddr=0.0.0.0:5062
;   IPv6 example: bindaddr=[::]:5062
;
; The address family of the bound UDP address is used to determine how Asterisk performs
; DNS lookups. In cases a) and c) above, only A records are considered. In case b), only
; AAAA records are considered. In case d), both A and AAAA records are considered. Note,
; however, that Asterisk ignores all records except the first one. In case d), when both A
; and AAAA records are available, either an A or AAAA record will be first, and which one
; depends on the operating system. On systems using glibc, AAAA records are given
; priority.
